Today: 2 weeks and 2 days!👀

-- TIPS --
CREATE A BOILER PLATE PROJECT
	-setup pom.xml, application properties, login-reg, MySQL db ready with a User
	-User model with name, email, password, confirm (transient)
	
Look at wireframe (PSEUDOCODE) (~10 mins writing out features and relationships)
👉 Ask Clarification questions

EXAM is emulating a take home challege
The exam is writen as a real life example of a potential employeer giving you a timed excersise to test your knowledge


1. Take 100% of the exam time! (4.5 hours + 30 mins)
DO NOT DROP EARLY - take breaks

2. Don't panic!
- the only risk here is for you to find and expose a weakness to study and correct! 🙂

3. Don't watch the clock ⏳
- set alarms for mid way - last hour and last 20 mins

4. Start with what you know
some black-belt features may require to drop the db and do a different relationships

5. Don't start the exam until you have your environment setup and ready
(boiler plate)

6. use exam instructions as checklist and follow the yellow sticky notes
- double check before submitting
- don't overthink features - do only what the exam asks

7. use the platform - 100% of the RED BELT features are IN the platform.

8. If you have trouble submitting - let me know

9. Don't go over time, submit anyway I will still code review it with you.
- ALWAYS submit what you have
- not submiting is automatic FAIL

10. Even if you are feeling nervous - Take the exam anyway as an assignment and finish it

11. You don't have to submit a video*

12. STAY IN ZOOM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME OF THE EXAM (even if you are not taking an exam)
- DON'T EXIT ZOOM 
- DON'T JOIN ANOTHER DISCORD SERVER 
-> VOID THE EXAM

13. Join lecture room so I can assign you to an exam room
9:00 - 10:00

14. DO NOT ENTER a TA HELP CHANNEL
-> VOID THE EXAM

15. Don't cheat. PERIOD
- it's very easy to catch cheaters
- code is like a fingerprint
- you need to feel comfortable about what you do and do not know to survive an engineering role
